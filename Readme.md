# Socket Pong

A WebSocket Protocol based Pong game for the terminal. Only local play is currently implemented so stay tuned!

Originally, I wanted this project to have WebSockets integrated for online play in the first version, but I deemed that to be out of scope after I needed to learn some major things about how Node's terminal works.

The graphical display in the terminal does **NOT** depend on ncurses.

## Installation and Running:

```
npm install -g socket-pong
pong
```

## Example Game:

This is an example game that can be played with Socket-Pong:
